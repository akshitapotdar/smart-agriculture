Smart agriculture, also known as precision agriculture, is a modern farming practice that uses advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (loT) and machine learning (ML) to improve crop yield, reduce resource waste, and increase efficiency.
IoT sensors are used to gather data from various sources such as soil pH levels, tem-perature, humidity, and crop growth. This data is then analysed using ML algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can be used to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
Smart agriculture also includes the use of IOT for tasks such as crop monitoring, mapping, and spraying. These technologies help farmers make informed decisions about their crops and improve their overall efficiency and productivity.

OVERVIEW
---------
A smart agriculture project using IoT and ML typically involves the following steps:
* Identify the goals of the project: The first step in any smart agriculture project is to identify the specific goals and objectives that the project aims to achieve.
This could include increasing crop yield, reducing resource waste, or improving efficiency.
* Collect data: IoT sensors are used to gather data from various sources such as soil pH levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth. This data is typical-lyfor analysis.
*  Analyse data: Once the data has been collected, it is analysed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can be used to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
* Implement recommendations: Based on the analysis of the data, recommendations can be made to the farmer about how to optimize their farming practices.
This could include adjusting irrigation schedules, applying different fertiliz-ers, or using different pest control methods.
* Monitor results: The results of the project should be monitored over time to assess the effectiveness of the recommendations and to make any necessary
adjustments.

TEST CASES
-----------
Test Case 1: Temperature Threshold Alert
Test Description: Verify that the system generates an alert when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
Test Steps:Set the temperature value to 35Â°C (above the threshold).
Observe the system's response.
Expected Result: The system should generate an alert indicating high temperature.

Test Case 2: Humidity Threshold Alert
Test Description: Verify that the system generates an alert when the humidity falls below a specified threshold.
Test Steps:
Set the humidity value to 30% (below the threshold).
Monitor the system's behavior.
Expected Result: The system should generate an alert indicating low humidity.
